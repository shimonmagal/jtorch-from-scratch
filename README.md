# jtorch-from-scratch
Being such a big fan of pytorch and also of sentdex, I decided to try and implement "jtorch" (a simplifed version of pytorch in java) from scratch.

I think this can be a really great project for me to learn more subtleties of Neural networks.

Shout out to https://github.com/Sentdex

This project is still WIP - I still need to implement:
- finish MNIST testing
  - this includes also shuffle, epoch and batches
  - this also includes validating with MNIST test data
- loss function
- back propogation
